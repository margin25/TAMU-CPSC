During today's seminar we listened to a Ted talk from Stuart Firestein. Stuart Firestein is a professor at Columbia University and the title of his talk was the Pursuit of Ignorance. Firestein talks about how ignorance plays such a big role in science and the process of learning it. He also argues that the current education system is ineffective as it only tests students ability to retain information rather than encouraging scientific thinking. He states that true science is not the memorization of scientific information but rather the questioning of the unknown. It is through the lack of knowledge and the ignorance of prior scientific findings that we are motivated to make new scientific discoveries. Firestein goes on to discuss some of the assumptions we make about science. He mentions that the puzzle model is inaccurate as scientists do not patiently put together the pieces of the science puzzle to reveal a grand scheme. This is true because science is not always guaranteed a solution while the manufacturer of the puzzle always guarantees a solution.  Another model he challenges is the onion model as scientists do not unravel discoveries to get to a fundamental kernel of truth. He mentions a few other models like the iceberg model and later concludes that the magic well model is the most accurate representation of true science as knowledge generates ignorance like a magic well would where no matter how many buckets you take out there's always another bucket of water to be had. I really enjoyed listening to Firestein's perspective on science and the education system as I do believe the current structure of school does not allow lots of room for scientific reasoning and is mostly a test of data/information retention. I am very curious about the course content of the Ignorance class he teaches at Columbia.
