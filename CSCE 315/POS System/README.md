# Project Description
Your team will design and develop a point of sale and inventory solution for Layne's restaurant that includes a database management system (DBMS) to house order history and inventory data and a corresponding graphical user interface (GUI) for employees. Layne's has multiple choices for drinks, main dishes, and sides.
Your team's solution will address two different groups of users: servers and managers. 
During service times, servers will be able to enter customer orders and the system will update the restaurant's order history data.
After hours, managers will be able to analyze trends in the order history data over user-specified time intervals and create restocking orders to replenish their on-hand inventory. 
Your team will be provided with initial order history data and inventory data which your team will need to manipulate to store in your system.
This is a team-based project, with three to four students per team decided by the instructor. You will need to work together to design and build the DBMS, create the GUIs, and construct the connection between your local application and data housed in the cloud. Note that teams with more members will be given additional deliverables to balance the amount of work per student.
